# DOTA 2 Data Generator

Feed in your Steam directory and this will generate user-friendly DOTA 2 data, as seen in the DOTA2DATA folder

## Usage

Requires node.js and python 3 (sorry about this, I used this as an opportunity to learn some node).

Usage: `python generate.py [-h] [-o OutputDir] SteamDir`

e.g. `python generate.py -o "C:\Users\Gaben\Desktop" "C:\Program Files\Steam"`
